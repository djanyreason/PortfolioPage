This repository is a single page React app website to display web development projects in my personal portfolio.

The project is built in React, and uses Redux for state management. It does not interface with a backend, but it is structured as if it could do so were there a backend server running to supply the portfolio project data.

The website can be seen live at https://djannyreason.github.io/PortfolioPage/
